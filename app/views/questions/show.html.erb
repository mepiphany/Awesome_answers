<%# Steps to making form_for answers %>

<h2>Answers</h2>
<h3>Create an Answer</h3>
<%# Less ideal one %>
<%# we can use the form after overriding the 'url' parameter. The downside to it
is that it won't work for 'edit' situation. This will only work in 'create'
situation. So we can't reuse it we decide to implement editing answers. %>

<%#= form_for @answer, url: question_answers_path(@question) do |f| %>

<%# end %>

<%= @answer.errors.full_messages.join(", ") %>

<%# ideal way %>

<%# passing an array to the 'form_for' is a better approach for creating nested resources. this
approach will work for both new / edit situations. So if @answer is not persisted it will send a
POST request to question_answer_path(@question). And if @answer is persisted it will send a PATCH
request to question_answer_path(@question,@answer) %>
<%= form_for [@question, @answer] do |f| %>
<div>
  <%= f.label :body  %>
  <%= f.text_area :body  %>
</div>
<%= f.submit  %>

<% end %>

<%# @question is from what we captured from the controller
answers comes from has_many :answers method%>

<% @question.answers.each do |ans| %>
<%= ans.body %>
<% if can? :destroy, ans %>
<%= link_to "Delete", question_answer_path(@question, ans),
                      method: :delete,
                      data: { confirm: "Are you Sure?" } %>
<% end %>
<hr>
