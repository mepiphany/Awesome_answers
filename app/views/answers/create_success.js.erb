  <%# j is a helper method from rails to escape the Javascript so it doesn't
  break beacuse of the quotes and new lines characters %>
  $('.answers').prepend('<%= j render "answer", answer: @answer  %>');

  <%#= we will need to reset @answer to be 'Answer.new' because @answer is now
  persisted and this will make the form submit an update request instead of a create request. %>
  <% @answer = Answer.new  %>

  $('#answer-form').html("<%= j render 'form' %>");
